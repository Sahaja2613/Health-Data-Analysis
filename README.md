# Health-Data-Analysis


## About:

A Healthcare Data Analyst extremely determined to transform health data into actionable insights that impact Clinical decision making, patient outcomes and optimize healthcare operations using advanced analytical experience like SQL, Python, SAS and R programming. With deeper understanding of healthcare delivery systems, clinical research, EHR, claims data and population health with integration of statistical analysis, predictive analysis and data visualization help to support strategic initiatives in healthcare settings. With an enthusiasm to continues learning in health data analysis, I will ensure to contribute to developments in healthcare quality, efficacy and patient safety.

## Portfolio Projects:

### SQL:

#### a. EHR dataset - Cancer Diagnosis:

Goal: To demonstrate proficiency in data wrangling, data exploration, and advanced SQL querying techniques applied to EHR data. To provide meaningful insights related to cancer diagnoses, patient demographics, diagnostic methods, and treatment outcomes.

Description: The EHR dataset - cancer diagnosis from Kaggle is a dataset containing clinical records of cancer diagnoses. The dataset typically includes information such as patient demographics, cancer type, diagnostic methods, treatment protocols, and outcomes. It may also contain other healthcare-related details like age, gender, region, survival status, and diagnostic date. It gives information about Cancer diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

Skills Used: SQL.

#### b. Patient Health Sample Data:

Goal: To analyze patient records, medications, appointments and billing information to help enhance patient care management and improve operational efficiency.

Description: Analyze patient data, address its challenges by showing performance metrics and help in decision making and resource allocation.

Skills Used: SQL Advanced queries

### Python:

#### Prediction of Hospital Readmissions using Patient data:

Goal: To explore, understand, and extract actionable insights that can help reduce hospital readmission rates, improve patient care, and optimize hospital management practices.

Description: The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) dataset from data.cms.gov includes data on hospital readmissions for Medicare beneficiaries, focusing on specific conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction. The HRRP was established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Affordable Care Act to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions. Hospitals with higher-than-expected readmission rates for certain conditions face financial penalties under this program.

Skills used: Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Modeling Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Cross-validation.

### R Programming:

#### U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI):

Goal: Perform data analysis on the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) 2023 Release dataset from data.cdc.gov and to explore and analyze key chronic disease data to derive insights that can help inform public health policies, healthcare planning, and disease prevention strategies.

Description: This dataset encompasses a variety of chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory diseases, among others. The data also includes demographic information such as age, gender, race, and socioeconomic factors that can help in understanding the distribution and impact of these diseases. Analysis was made to Identify patterns and trends in chronic disease prevalence, provide actionable insights to inform public health strategies, health improvements and resource allocation.

Skills Used: R programming.

### SAS:

#### Gene Mutations Identified in Blood Samples:

Goal: It contains data from patients whose tumor-blood pairs were analyzed to identify mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis. For early diagnosis and impact of treatment of the condition.

Description: The dataset from cbioportal.org captures genetic mutations from blood samples of cancer patients and provides information on clonal hematopoiesis, a condition where mutations in blood cells accumulate with aging and are associated with an increased risk of hematologic diseases and potentially cancer. Analyzing the dataset with SAS, the primary goal would be to derive insights into the prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis mutations, their association with various cancer types, and the potential clinical significance of these mutations.

Skills Used: Base SAS.
